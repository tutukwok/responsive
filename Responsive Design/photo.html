            <p>AI features in editing software like Photoshop, Canva, Picsart, etc... changed the way photo editing used to be known. Before the addition of AI, many people shied away from using software such as Photoshop and Lightroom as it required users to have some knowledge of Adobe Suite to properly edit a decent photograph.

            That changed when Adobe introduced AI features to its users. Now users can generate and change the details of a photo with just one click. This helps users who struggle with Adobe complex tools as AI can help with background removal, object selection, and retouching. AI features like content-aware fill and cropping inspire creativity and encourage users to experiment with different editing techniques. This creates many trends on social media where people share their end products. This also contributed to the bloom of AI artists.
